"RouteWeather"

RouteWeather provides weather forcast information at each point along a journey at the time the user is expected to arrive at that point. The user inputs an origin, destination, departure time and a route map is generated showing time-calibrated weather information for positions along the route. This project required coordinating the responses of multiple interconnected APIs (Google Directions, OpenWeather and Google JS Map) and provided experience in the documentation of more complicated APIs among other challenges.
